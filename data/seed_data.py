In 2024, the nominal construction volume is likely to contract by around 3.5 percent, declining for the first time since the financial crisis due to falling construction prices. Residential construction in particular experienced a sharp decline in 2023 and will continue on this downward trend more strongly in 2024. Renovation and modernization activity is less affected than new construction. The situation will stabilize by 2025. The prospect of constructing 400,000 new residences annually is thus becoming increasingly out of reach.

Thus, growth has slightly picked up again. In some of the groups of companies analyzed, the figure was even higher. Around 23 percent of executive board members at the DAX 40 companies, for example, are women. The largest banks and insurance companies, which in the past years have lagged considerably behind other private sector companies and companies with government-owned shares, managed to catch up a bit. In many places, this growth is due to the fact that companies have appointed a woman to their executive board for the first time. Beyond that, there is currently not much progress. In addition, the number of women holding the position of CEO has decreased in many groups of companies. More commitment is needed from companies, both internally (e.g., from the supervisory board) and externally (e.g., from investors) to achieve gender parity in senior leadership positions."

An analysis of 321 sovereign debt restructurings since 1815 shows that foreign private and institutional investor losses were 43 percent on average. Notably, beginning in the 1970s, several debt exchanges have increasingly been required to resolve a default. To understand this new phenomenon better, this Weekly Report looks at total creditor losses across all restructurings during a default spell. Instead of focusing on each individual restructuring, the cumulative haircut adds up all losses across a default spell. These calculations show that debt crises with serial restructurings resulted in greater overall losses for creditors than a major one-off restructuring."

Multilateral cooperation amplified the force of sanctions levied against Russia in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea. The EU was a pivotal player within the sanctioning coalition, accounting for 78 percent of the total welfare loss inflicted on Russia. Baltic economies shouldered disproportionately high economic burdens from Russia sanctions. Adjustment funds and other burden-sharing policies could reduce these asymmetries, thus enhancing the stability of sanction coalitions. This report demonstrates that multilateral cooperation through coalitions simultaneously reduced domestic welfare losses incurred from sanctions and intensified welfare losses imposed on Russia. Results also reveal significant disparities within the coalition, with Russia sanctions placing relatively high economic costs on Baltic nations that can be mitigated through a burden-sharing program. Hypothetical cooperation by emerging economies like China is also shown to substantially raise the force of sanctions against Russia."

Using the German family panel pairfam, this study examines how couples divided care work during and around the coronavirus pandemic. Many feared that there would be a return to traditional genders roles due to the pandemic; at first, mothers more often (almost) entirely took care of children and the household. However, new data show that the gender care gap has now returned to its pre-pandemic level. Yet differences in the division of care work in Germany remain high, also in an international comparison. This Weekly Report shows that the gender care gap has since returned to its—albeit still high—pre-pandemic level. If policymakers want to effectively combat gender inequalities on the labor market, they should focus more on the unequal division of care work and dismantle existing barriers preventing a more equal division."

Inflation, which is falling in both Germany and the euro area overall, is expected to return close to the European Central Bank's two-percent target, suggesting that a turnaround in interest rates can be expected in early summer. Better financing conditions and the slowdown in price momentum are likely to somewhat boost both private consumption as well as corporate investments over the course of 2024. Nevertheless, there is currently still a great deal of uncertainty, particular in regard to the future economic policy environment, which is causing households and companies to remain cautious in Germany. German GDP will virtually stagnate and, carried by private consumption and public investments in equipment, increase more markedly by 1.2 percent in 2025. The global economy will continue to develop more robustly than Germany; it is projected to increase by 3.5 percent in both 2024 and 2025, which should gradually strengthen German exports."

Scenario with an extended exclusion period shows: People with low level of education or little German knowledge are affected in particular. Electronic health insurance card for refugees can cushion the negative effects of the changes to the AsylbLG by dismantling administrative barriers. Access to health care should be simplified to save costs for the government in the long term.

This Weekly Report analyzes to what extent municipalities can partially decommission the natural gas infrastructure with the help of municipal heat planning and by re-municipalizing the gas industry. The study also outlines the challenges associated with these instruments. Accordingly, re-municipalization does not necessarily result in the gas networks being decommissioned faster, a fact that remains unconsidered in the existing heat plans.

Model-based analysis investigates medium-term development of the German electricity market. Electricity market withstood energy crises and the shutdown of the last nuclear power plants. An electricity supply powered by 80 percent renewable energy sources in 2023 is possible without nuclear and coal-fired power plants. The 2023 German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) stipulates that at least 80 percent of electricity consumption must come from renewable energy sources by 2030. This implies that up to 600 terawatt hours (TWh) must be generated from renewable energy, compared to around 260 TWh today. Policymakers somewhat deprioritized this target following the 2022 energy crisis. However, the German and European electricity markets have since stabilized; electricity as well as natural gas prices are now about the same as they were before the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. This clears the way for the next steps to be taken, in particular accelerating the expansion of renewable energy sources and driving the coal phase-out, and subsequently the natural gas phase-out, forward. This Weekly Report updates earlier model-based scenario analyses and discusses the results from 2022 and beyond. Despite major uncertainties, the German electricity market's security of supply was never at risk at any point in time. This was due to large power plants' existing excess capacities as well as the expansion of renewable energy sources."

A Worst-First approach, prioritizing the retrofit of inefficient buildings, would address energy- and social policy objectives and deliver economic and climate benefits. Data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) show how such an approach would protect especially low-income households often living in very inefficient buildings from heating costs risks. This group comprises 28 percent of all tenants and 13 percent of all homeowners. Yet, uncertainty about the cost-benefit of retrofitting and other priorities of homeowners mean that not enough buildings are retrofitted. As a result, the saving potentials, especially from very inefficient buildings, are not being realized. This would, however, be necessary to reduce heating cost risks and energy import dependency, and to meet climate targets. Better alignment of financing and subsidy instruments with the ownership structure, the further development of building standards to include minimum energy performance standards, and reform of tenancy law could improve the situation."

Study investigates how the share of people living in Germany who send remittances abroad has changed. Seven percent of refugees sent remittances abroad and the trend is continuing downward. Remittances abroad provide an important contribution to development and should be reevaluated. This Weekly Report investigates how the share of people living in Germany who send remittances abroad has changed over time according to their migration background (with or without a refugee background) and which factors influence the likelihood of remitting. Based on Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data as well as the IAB-SOEP Migration Samples and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey from 2013 to 2022, the analysis shows that migrants without a refugee background send remittances more often, while refugees are often rarely able to send remittances due to structural barriers."
